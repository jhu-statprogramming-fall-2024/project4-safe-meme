    "text": "Types of Vegetation Metrics\n\nEvapotranspiration (ET): Measures the total water loss from soil and plants; higher ET indicates active plant growth and sufficient water availability. Over 25 years, an overall decrease in ET due to climate change could indicate reduced plant activity or increased water stress.\nFraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR): Represents the fraction of sunlight absorbed by vegetation for photosynthesis; higher FPAR denotes healthier, more productive crops. Over 25 years, a declining FPAR trend could indicate an overall reduction in crop canopy density.\nLeaf Area Index (LAI): Quantifies the total leaf area per unit ground area; higher LAI reflects denser foliage and robust plant growth. Over 25 years, an overall decrease in LAI over time could point to diminished vegetation cover or stunted growth.\nEnhanced Vegetation Index (EVI): An index that enhances vegetation signals by reducing atmospheric and soil background noise; higher EVI values correspond to healthier vegetation. Over 25 years, a downward trend in EVI might indicate declining vegetation vigor.\nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): Assesses vegetation greenness by comparing red and near-infrared reflectance; higher NDVI values signify healthier, greener vegetation. Over 25 years, a decrease in NDVI over 25 years could suggest reduced vegetation health or coverage.\nNDVI and EVI capture vegetation greenness and vigor, offering a direct assessment of plant health, whereas LAI, FPAR, and ET provide information on structural and functional aspects of vegetation. The scientific basis for preferring NDVI/EVI lies in their sensitivity to chlorophyll content and ability to detect changes in vegetation health more directly. The general hypothesis is: if the climate in 2000 was more favorable for crops than in 2024, we would expect to see higher values of ET, FPAR, LAI, EVI, and NDVI in 2000, reflecting more vigorous plant growth, denser foliage, and healthier vegetation due to optimal growing conditions."

Understanding climate-driven changes in cropland productivity is essential for all community stakeholders, including policymakers and farmers, to make informed decisions and adapt effectively. To achieve these objectives, our project aims to integrate three key datasets: one for mapping US croplands, one serving as a proxy for vegetation health through metrics such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and one for climate data, including temperature and precipitation."

This also is to be expected because crops tend to do better in the summer when the temperature is warmer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext we plot NDVI as a function of precipitation. This plot is harder to see direct correlation between NDVI and precipitation but it gives us a sense of what the data look like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we plot the relationship between NDVI and EVI which seems to be correlated, which would be expected because they are different measurements for plant health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow now make pairwise scatter plots of climate and vegetation variables of interest. These scatter plots look like they show linear correlations between the vegetation variables (NDVI and EVI) and temperature.
